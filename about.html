            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Monterey Bay is a beautiful and diverse marine ecosystem located along the central coast of California. The bay is home to a wide variety of marine life, including sea otters, seals, sea lions, whales, dolphins, sharks, and numerous species of fish and birds. The unique underwater geography, including a massive submarine canyon, creates a nutrient-rich environment that supports an abundance of life.

            <p>
                The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) was established in 1992 to protect the bay's unique ecosystem and rich biodiversity. Spanning over 6,000 square miles, the MBNMS is one of the largest marine protected areas in the United States. It is managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and aims to conserve, protect, and enhance the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the area.
